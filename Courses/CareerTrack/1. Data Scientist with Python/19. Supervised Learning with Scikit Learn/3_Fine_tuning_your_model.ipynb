        "In Chapter 1, you evaluated the performance of your k-NN classifier based on its accuracy. However, as Andy discussed, accuracy is not always an informative metric. In this exercise, you will dive more deeply into evaluating the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may have noticed in the video that the classification report consisted of three rows, and an additional support column. The support gives the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class - so in the video example, the support was the number of Republicans or Democrats in the test set on which the classification report was computed. The precision, recall, and f1-score columns, then, gave the respective metrics for that particular class.\n",

        "Here, you'll work with the PIMA Indians dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes. As in Chapters 1 and 2, the dataset has been preprocessed to deal with missing values."

        "Great job in the previous exercise - you now have a new addition to your toolbox of classifiers!\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification reports and confusion matrices are great methods to quantitatively evaluate model performance, while ROC curves provide a way to visually evaluate models. As Hugo demonstrated in the video, most classifiers in scikit-learn have a .predict_proba() method which returns the probability of a given sample being in a particular class. Having built a logistic regression model, you'll now evaluate its performance by plotting an ROC curve. In doing so, you'll make use of the .predict_proba() method and become familiar with its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, you'll continue working with the PIMA Indians diabetes dataset. The classifier has already been fit to the training data and is available as logreg."

        "Say you have a binary classifier that in fact is just randomly making guesses. It would be correct approximately 50% of the time, and the resulting ROC curve would be a diagonal line in which the True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate are always equal. The Area under this ROC curve would be 0.5. This is one way in which the AUC, which Hugo discussed in the video, is an informative metric to evaluate a model. If the AUC is greater than 0.5, the model is better than random guessing. Always a good sign!\n",

A solution to this is to use RandomizedSearchCV, in which not all hyperparameter values are tried out.

Decision trees have many parameters that can be tuned, such as max_features, max_depth, and min_samples_leaf: This makes it an ideal use case for RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
